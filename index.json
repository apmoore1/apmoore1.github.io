Language models and learning methods are so complex that scientific conference papers no longer contain enough space for the technical depth required for replication or reproduction. Taking Target Dependent Sentiment Analysis as a case study, we show how recent work in the field has not consistently released code, or described settings for learning methods in enough detail, and lacks comparability and generalisability in train, test or validation data. To investigate generalisability and to enable state of the art comparative evaluations, we carry out the first reproduction studies of three groups of complementary methods and perform the first large-scale mass evaluation on six different English datasets. Reflecting on our experiences, we recommend that future replication or reproduction experiments should always consider a variety of datasets alongside documenting and releasing their methods and published code in order to minimise the barriers to both repeatability and generalisability. We have released our code with a model zoo on GitHub with Jupyter Notebooks to aid understanding and full documentation, and we recommend that others do the same with their papers at submission time through an anonymised GitHub account.","tags":null,"title":"Bringing replication and reproduction together with generalisability in NLP: Three reproduction studies for Target Dependent Sentiment Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew Moore"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519992000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519992000,"objectID":"1de466392db48b142813435f5e329705","permalink":"/talk/scc_phd_conference_2018/","publishdate":"2018-03-02T13:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/scc_phd_conference_2018/","section":"talk","summary":"I go over the importance of domain specific sentiment lexicons within the finicial domain.

Very large scale text analysis is already carried out in corpus-based language analysis by employing methods such as frequency profiling, keywords, concordancing, collocations and n-grams. However, at present only basic visualisation methods are utilised. In this paper, we describe case studies of multiple types of key word clouds, explorer tools for collocation networks, and compare network and language distance visualisations for online social networks. These are shown to fit better with the iterative data-driven corpus methodology, and permit some level of scalability to cope with ever increasing corpus size and complexity. In addition, they will allow corpus linguistic methods to be used more widely in the digital humanities and social sciences since the learning curve with visualisations is shallower for non-experts.","tags":null,"title":"Towards Interactive Multidimensional Visualisations for Corpus Linguistics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew Moore","Paul Rayson","Steven Young"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1462060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1462060800,"objectID":"4b21f131b76cc496a3ca314412cd83ed","permalink":"/publication/moore-2016-domain/","publishdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moore-2016-domain/","section":"publication","summary":"As part of a larger project where we are examining the relationship and influence of news and social media on stock price, here we investigate the potential links between the sentiment of news articles about companies and stock price change of those companies. We describe a method to adapt sentiment word lists based on news articles about specific companies, in our case downloaded from the Guardian. Our novel approach here is to adapt word lists in sentiment classifiers for news articles based on the relevant stock price change of a company at the time of web publication of the articles. This adaptable word list approach is compared against the financial lexicon from Loughran and McDonald (2011) as well as the more general MPQA word list (Wilson et al., 2005). Our experiments investigate the need for domain specific word lists and demonstrate how general word lists miss indicators of sentiment by not creating or adapting lists that come directly from news about the company. The companies in our experiments are BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Volkswagen.","tags":null,"title":"Domain Adaptation using Stock Market Prices to Refine Sentiment Dictionaries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mahmoud El-Haj","Paul Rayson","Steve Young","Andrew Moore","Martin Walker","Thomas Schleicher","Vasiliki Athanasakou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1462060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1462060800,"objectID":"79f66e19a37cd3b203816d67042b12a4","permalink":"/publication/el-haj-etal-2016-learning/","publishdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/el-haj-etal-2016-learning/","section":"publication","summary":"Attribution bias refers to the tendency of people to attribute successes to their own abilities but failures to external factors. In a business context an internal factor might be the restructuring of the firm and an external factor might be an unfavourable change in exchange or interest rates. In accounting research, the presence of an attribution bias has been demonstrated for the narrative sections of the annual financial reports. Previous studies have applied manual content analysis to this problem but in this paper we present novel work to automate the analysis of attribution bias through using machine learning algorithms. Previous studies have only applied manual content analysis on a small scale to reveal such a bias in the narrative section of annual financial reports. In our work a group of experts in accounting and finance labelled and annotated a list of 32,449 sentences from a random sample of UK Preliminary Earning Announcements (PEAs) to allow us to examine whether sentences in PEAs contain internal or external attribution and which kinds of attributions are linked to positive or negative performance. We wished to examine whether human annotators could agree on coding this difficult task and whether Machine Learning (ML) could be applied reliably to replicate the coding process on a much larger scale. Our best machine learning algorithm correctly classified performance sentences with 70% accuracy and detected tone and attribution in financial PEAs with accuracy of 79%.","tags":null,"title":"Learning Tone and Attribution for Financial Text Mining","type":"publication"}]
